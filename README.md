Rhythmbox Tempo control
=======================
This is a Rhythmbox 3.x plugin that allows the playback speed to be increased
or decreased. It is similar in spirit to rbpitch, but works on Rhythmbox 3. It
is not as feature-complete as rbpitch.

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.
You will also need the gstreamer "bad" plugins e.g.,
`libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0` on Ubuntu 22.04.

Apparently this plugin is not compatible with the Rhythmbox "alternative
toolbar" plugin.

Usage
-----
In the toolbar there is a slider next to which +0% is written. Drag the slider
to adjust the speed. There is a button next to the slider which resets the
speed to normal (+0%).
